Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, The George Washington University, Dec. 2024 (expected)
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering, The George Washington University, May 2019
* B.S. in Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Jul. 2017

Work experience
======
* **Optical Research Intern** at **Cable Television Laboratories**, Jan. to Jul. 2023
  * Designed and implemented a Software Network Simulator in Python for the passive optical networks, where the different network standards/protocols can be simulated 35% faster than conventional optical network simulators.
  * Proposed a novel Software-Defined Algorithm in Python for resource allocation in passive optical networks, where the average latency of the network is reduced by 46% and 56% in different traffic load scenarios with bursty traffic

* **Research Assistant** at **George Washington University**, Jan. to Jul. 2023
  * Designed and published a Deep Reinforcement Learning Multi-Task Model for network management in Python with CNN/GNN, where the network operation performs 49% better than the heuristic algorithms in throughput.
  * Implemented a new Reinforcement Learning environment with PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, and GYM, where the network status embedding and reward of network operation are formulated and customized for the optical network.
  *  Designed a novel UAV Edge-server system where the System Embedding and Offloading are controlled by a Deep Learning model to balance the tradeoff between YOLO accuracy, latency, and Hardware power consumption
  *  Designed novel network protection and recovery algorithms to increase network survivability and robustness against different types of potential network failures.
  *  Implemented a Software Network Simulation program in Python and C++ for network performance testing, where
the network scheduling and traffic assignment are simulated by the software to evaluate different network algorithms.
