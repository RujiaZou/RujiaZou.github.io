Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, The George Washington University, Dec. 2024 (expected)
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering, The George Washington University, May 2019
* B.S. in Telecommunication Engineering, Xidian University, Jul. 2017

Work experience
======
* **Optical Research Intern** at **Cable Television Laboratories**, Jan. to Jul. 2023
  * Designed and implemented a Software Network Simulator in Python for the passive optical networks, where the
different network standards/protocols can be simulated 35% faster than conventional optical network simulators.
  * Proposed a novel Software-Defined Algorithm in Python for resource allocation in passive optical networks, where
the average latency of the network is reduced by 46% and 56% in different traffic load scenarios with bursty traffic
